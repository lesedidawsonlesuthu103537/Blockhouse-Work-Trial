# Blockhouse Work Trial
The purpose of this project was to evaluate cross-asset impacts on short-term price changes. To do this, the contemporaneous returns of each stock under investigation were regressed against the best-level OFI and integrated OFI (Order Flow Imbalance) metrics of all companies under investigation. This was done to determine the effect of the self-impact and cross-impact terms on mid-price changes. Once this analysis was done, the OFI metrics were regressed against future returns to determine the ability of the OFI to forecast short-term price changes.
