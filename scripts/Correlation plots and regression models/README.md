# Correlation plots and regression models
This folder contains the Python scripts for the plotting of the correlation plots and the running of the regression models. The inputs to these scripts are the outputs of the scripts in the Data cleaning and OFI calculation folder, which has a README that specifies the outputs. The Corr.py outputs the heatmaps of the correlation plots for the 10 OFI levels of the various companies being investigated. The Reg.py script outputs a summary of the mean and standard deviation of the self impacts, cross impacts and adjusted R^{2} for the regression models ran on both the best-level OFI and integrated OFI
