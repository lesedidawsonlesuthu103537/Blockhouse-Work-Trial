# Regression results
This folder contains pictures of the tables of the regression results obtained from running the OLS regression models mentioned in the report. The first picture shows the summary of the mean and standard deviations of the coefficients self-impact,cross-impacts and the adjusted R^{2}. The self- and cross-impacts were regressed against contemporaneous returns, and the results are shown for both the best-level OFI models and the integrated OFI models. The second picture has the same information, except now the response variable is the future one-minute returns.
